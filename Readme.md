# dice/pig game 

## Rules

In each turn player rolls a die repeatedly until either a 1 is rolled or player decides to hold and pass on the turn to its opponent.

The number player rolls is added to the current score. If player rolls a 1, they lose their current score and turn is passed to their opponent.

If player gets any other number, they can decide to continue and roll the die.

If player decides to hold, then their current scores are added to overall score.

The first player to score 100 wins the game.

**NB: The players can decide to set predetermined score at the beginning of the game**
